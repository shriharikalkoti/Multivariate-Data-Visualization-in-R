# Multivariate-Data-Visualization-in-R
This project showcases multivariate data visualization in R using a private contacts dataset. It demonstrates how 2D/3D plots, parallel coordinates, and Chernoff faces help reveal patterns and relationships in complex data. Tools like ggplot2, plot3D, GGally, and aplpack are used to create intuitive graphics that support deeper data interpretation.
